# Project 6: Currency Exchange API
By Faisal Rana

## Description of program
This is a website that will query a live currency exchange api using a currency input.  It will provide a list of all available currencies and will return the equivalent currency amount respective to the input and currency selected.  It will also return errors if there is error on the server level or user level. 
This is my 6th Project at Epicodus and the goal is to learn to work with asyncronous code by utilizing Promises, Fetch API and await/async functions.

## Technologies used
- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap
- Javascript
- jQuery
- Construcor function
- Prototype method
- ES6 Classes, Template Literals 
- Webpack 
- Jest
- Babel
- Lint
- Fetch API
- Promises
- Async Functions/Await
- .env used to mark API key

## Initial Plan

Jest was not used to create tests for this project.  However her was the initial plan:

1.  Create HTML for a currency converter website 
2.  Set up environment for webpack based project
3.  Add readme
4.  Sign up for currency exchange API and input key to .env file
5.  Set up environment that interacts with API exchange and is able to recieve date.
6.  Handle Errors and adjust code accordingly
7.  Test functionality and do not forget to commit after each step.
